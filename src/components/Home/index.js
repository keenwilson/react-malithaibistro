          Thank you for your patronage to Baramee Thai Bistro, and becoming a
          part of our extended Thai Family. The health and safety of our
          wonderful and hardworking team that prepares your meals and serves
          them, and you our wonderful customers, is our top priority. With the
          concern for our entire Thai Bistro family and our community, difficult
          decisionâ€™s must be made, and we have decided to close our restaurants
          until April 1st. Please follow us on our Facebook page and website for
          updates as we monitor the situation. We would like your feedback on
          potentially offering a curbside service by next week.
